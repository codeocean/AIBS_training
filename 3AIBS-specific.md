## Preprocessing and exploratory analysis of thalamus MERFISH data 

Each new Code Ocean Capsule is a git repo. You can make a Capsule by cloning a pre-existing git repo, in a way that uses the user's credentials and [maintains a connection to the original repo](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/git-provider-integration-guide/github-integration-user-guide), or without any credentials and [creates a new repo in Code Ocean](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/compute-capsule-basics/version-control/importing-a-capsule-from-a-git-provider).  By maintaining a link to the original repo, changes can be pushed and pulled between repos. 

In this section, we will: 
1. Create a Capsule from a GitHub template.
2. [Make an access token in GitHub and bring it into Code Ocean](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/git-provider-integration-guide/setting-up-the-integration). 
3. Clone the git repo with thalamus MERFISH data and analysis notebooks so that we can sync changes.
4. We will have to [set the environment](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/setting-up-the-environment) in the Capsule. 
5. Commit changes 
6. [Find](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/data-assets-guide/viewing-and-editing-data-assets/searching-a-data-asset) and [attach](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/data-assets-guide/attaching-datasets-to-a-capsule) Data Assets

You can run the notebooks in this Capsule by opening a [Cloud Workstation](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/cloud-workstation) or pressing the [Reproducible Run](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/compute-capsule-basics/reproducible-runs) button to run the Capsule code end-to-end, without any intervention.
