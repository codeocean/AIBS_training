# Create a reproducible analysis in the Cloud in 5 minutes

It takes only [5 minutes to create and run a Capsule in Code Ocean](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/quick-start-guide/create-a-capsule-in-5-minutes), with the following steps:
- Create a new Capsule
- Configuring the environment
- Use sample code and attach relevant Data Assets
- Perform a Reproducible Run 
A Reproducible Run executes the run file, which is a bash driver script. When executing a Reproducible Run, the run file will be the only file executed, and it will be executed end to end. Therefore, the driver script enables all desired results to be generated in an automated way without any human intervention.
