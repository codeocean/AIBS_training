## 	Automating workflows with the Code Ocean API

The Code Ocean API enables users to interact with Code Ocean programmatically, without using the web application. The Code Ocean API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts and returns JSON-encoded request bodies and responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

Once you have [set up an access token](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/code-ocean-api/authentication) in your account, many functions can be performed through the API. Some examples we will talk about include 
- creating and sharing [Data Assets](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/code-ocean-api/data-asset-api)
- running [Capsules and Pipelines](https://docs.codeocean.com/user-guide/code-ocean-api/computation-api)
- capturing and sharing results

We also have a Python SDK. The Code Ocean Python SDK makes it easy to leverage the full functionality of the extensive Code Ocean Public API in your Python scripts and applications.
